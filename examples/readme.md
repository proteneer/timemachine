### Examples

#### Dual Topology
  * `validate_relative_binding.py` runs a Dual Topology FEP calculation with a single reference compound (the blocker) as the hub in a star map.

#### Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
* `run_smc_on_biphenyl.py` uses SMC to estimate the hydration free energy of biphenyl
* `run_smc_on_freesolv.py` uses SMC to estimate hydration free energies on FreeSolv
