# Legacy code for identifying dummy groups and anchors in single topology transformations

The code here was mostly introduced in [#633](https://github.com/proteneer/timemachine/pull/633)
and refined in [#656](https://github.com/proteneer/timemachine/pull/656).

Simplified single topology, introduced in [#756](https://github.com/proteneer/timemachine/pull/756)
utilizes only a subset of the original functionality; the remainder was moved here to simplify maintenance.
