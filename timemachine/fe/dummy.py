def generate_dummy_group_assignments(

) -> Iterator[Dict[int, FrozenSet[int]]]:
    """Returns an iterator over dummy group assignments (i.e., candidate partitionings of dummy atoms with each
    partition assigned a bond anchor atom) for a given molecule (represented as a bond graph) and set of core atoms.

    A dummy group is a set of dummy atoms that are inserted or deleted in alchemical free energy calculations. The
    bonded terms that involve dummy atoms need to be judiciously pruned such that the partition function at the
    end-states remain factorizable, and cancelleable. Dummy groups are subject to the following constraints:

    1) They must not contain atoms in the core.
    2) Dummy groups do not interact with other dummy groups.
    3) Dummy groups interact with the core only through anchor atoms.

    While the choices of dummy groups is arbitrary, this function partitions the dummy atoms into multiple dummy groups
    using a heuristic:

    1) Generate an induced subgraph containing only dummy atoms
    2) Identify connected components of the induced subgraph (see note 1 below).
    3) Generate all possible mappings (bond anchor, connected component). In general there will be multiple
       possibilities since there may be an arbitrary choice of anchor atom for each dummy group
    4) For each mapping ("assignment"), merge connected components with the same bond anchor

    Example
    -------
    >>> from rdkit import Chem
    >>> from timemachine.graph_utils import convert_to_nx
    >>> mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles("OC1COO1")
    >>> bond_graph = convert_to_nx(mol)
    >>> core = [1, 2]
    >>> list(generate_dummy_group_assignments(bond_graph, core))
    [{1: frozenset({0}), 2: frozenset({3, 4})}, {1: frozenset({0, 3, 4})}]

    Parameters
    ----------
    bond_graph: networkx.Graph
        graph with atoms as nodes and bonds as edges

    core_atoms: list of int
        atoms in the core

    Returns
    -------
    iterator of dict
        each element is a mapping from bond anchor atom to dummy group

    Notes
    -----
    1. The final dummy groups are constructed as unions of one or more of the connected components of the dummy induced
       subgraph; in particular, we can never end up with a dummy group that is a subset of a connected component (the
       latter might be desirable for efficiency but is more complicated to implement).

    By convention, dummy atoms are added to A to transform it into a supergraph of B. Indices in the dummy_groups
    argument and in the return value refer to atoms in B.

    An anchored dummy group assignment is a set of triples (dummy group, j = bond anchor atom, k = angle anchor atom),
    where dummy atoms are connected to the core only through j, and k is a core neighbor of j where the bond (j, k)
    exists in both mol_a and mol_b. Note that k may be missing (None) if there are no valid choices.

    candidate dummy group assignments are generated.
