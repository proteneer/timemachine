# (ytz): Just like how one should never re-write an MD engine, one should never rewrite an MCS library.
# Unless you have to. And now we have to. If you want to understand what this code is doing, it
# is strongly recommended that the reader reads:

# Backtrack search algorithms and the maximal common subgraph problem
# James J McGregor,  January 1982, https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.4380120103

# Theoretical Tricks
# ------------------
# Historically, MCS methods have relied on finding the largest core as soon as possible. However, this can pose difficulties
# since we may get stuck in a local region of poor quality (that end up having far smaller than the optimal). Our algorithm
# has several clever tricks up its sleeve in that we:

# - designed the method for free energy methods where the provided two molecules are aligned.
# - refine the row/cols of marcs (edge-edge mapping matrix) when a new atom-atom mapping is proposed
# - prune by looking at maximum number of row edges and column edges, i.e. arcs_left min(max_row_edges, max_col_edges)
# - only generate an atom-mapping between two mols, whereas RDKit generates a common substructure between N mols
# - operate on anonymous graphs whose atom-atom compatibility depends on a predicates matrix, such that a 1 is when
#   if atom i in mol_a is compatible with atom j in mol_b, and 0 otherwise. We do not implement a bond-bond compatibility matrix.
# - allow for the generation of disconnected atom-mappings, which is very useful for linker changes etc.
# - re-order the vertices in graph based on the degree, this penalizes None mapping by the degree of the vertex
# - provide a hard guarantee for timeout, i.e. completion of the algorithm implies global optimum(s) have been found
# - when searching for atoms in mol_b to map, we prioritize based on distance
# - runs the recursive algorithm in iterations with thresholds, which avoids us getting stuck in a branch with a low
#   max_num_edges. we've seen cases where we get stuck in an edge size of 45 but optimal edge mapping has 52 edges.
# - termination guarantees correctness. otherwise an assertion is thrown since the distance (in terms of # of edges mapped)
#   is unknown relative to optimal.

# Engineering Tricks
# ------------------
# This is entirely written in python, which lends to its ease of use and modifiability. The following optimizations were
# implemented (without changing the number of nodes visited):
# - multiple representations of graph structures to improve efficiency
# - refinement of marcs matrix is done on uint8 arrays

    """
    Finds set of cores between two molecules that maximizes the number of common edges.

    If either atom i or atom j is in a ring then the dist(i,j) < ring_cutoff, otherwise dist(i,j) < chain_cutoff

    Additional notes
    ----------------
    1) The returned cores are sorted in increasing order based on the rmsd of the alignment.
    2) The number of cores atoms may vary slightly, but the number of mapped edges are the same.
    3) If a time-out has occured due to max_visits, then an exception is thrown.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mol_a: Chem.Mol
        Input molecule a. Must have a conformation.

    mol_b: Chem.Mol
        Input molecule b. Must have a conformation.

    ring_cutoff: float
        The distance cutoff that ring atoms must satisfy.

    chain_cutoff: float
        The distance cutoff that non-ring atoms must satisfy.

    max_visits: int
        Maximum number of nodes we can visit for a given threshold.

    connected_core: bool
        Set to True to only keep the largest connected
        subgraph in the mapping. The definition of connected
        here is different from McGregor. Here it means there
        is a way to reach the mapped atom without traversing
        over a non-mapped atom.

    max_cores: int or float
        maximum number of maximal cores to store, this can be an +np.inf if you want
        every core - when set to 1 this enables a faster predicate that allows for more pruning.

    enforce_core_core: bool
        If we allow core-core bonds to be broken. This may be deprecated later on.

    complete_rings: bool
        If we require mapped atoms that are in a ring to be complete.
        If True then connected_core must also be True.

    enforce_chiral: bool
        Filter out cores that would flip atom chirality

    min_threshold: int
        Number of atoms to require for a valid mapping

    Returns
    -------
    Returns a list of all_cores

    Raises

    timemachine.fe.mcgregor.NoMappingError
        If no mapping is found
    timemachine.fe.mcgregor.MaxVisitsError
