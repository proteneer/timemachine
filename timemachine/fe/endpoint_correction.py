        #     q_target(x) = exp(-U(x)), and we know min_x U(x) = 0, so we know max_x q_target(x) = 1.
        #     Our proposal is uniform over rotations, so q_proposal(x) is a constant.

        # If we used normalized_q_proposal(x) = 1 / pi^2, then M=pi^2 would be an appropriate constant
        # to use, guaranteeing q_target(x) / M normalized_q_proposal(x) <= 1 everywhere.

        # We could just as well set q_proposal(x) = 1 and M=1, which has exactly the same effect.

        # However, mixing and matching these could lead to errors.

        # For example, it would be incorrect to use normalized_q_proposal(x) = 1 / pi^2, M=1, as we
        # could now sample x where q_target(x) / M normalized_q_proposal(x) > 1. Setting M too small

        # runtime assertion.

        # On the other hand, setting M larger than needed does not impact the correctness of the
        # sampler, although it impacts the efficiency. I think a previous version of this code set M ~10x
        # larger than it needed to be, by implicitly using q_proposal(x) = 1, and picking M = pi^2.

    k_rotation: float
        Force constant of the rotational restraint

    core_idxs: int NDArray (C, 2)

        Bonded parameters of the intractable restraint

    lhs_xs: NDArray [T, N, 3]
        Samples from the intractable left hand state, with the restraints turned on.

    rhs_xs: NDArray [T, N, 3]
