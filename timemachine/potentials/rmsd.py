def rmsd_align(x1, x2):
    """
    Optimally align x1 and x2 via rigid translation and rotations.

    The returned alignment is a proper rotation. Note while it is technically
    possible to find an ever better alignment if we were to allow for reflections,
    there are technical difficulties with defining what the "standard" rotation is,
    i.e. either np.eye(3) or -np.eye(3). We can revisit this at a later time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1: np.ndarray (N,3)
        conformation 1

    x1: np.ndarray (N,3)
        conformation 2

    Returns
    -------
    2-tuple
        Return a pair of aligned (N,3) ndarrays. Each conformer has its centroid
        set to the origin.

    Compute a rigid RMSD restraint using two groups of atoms. group_a_idxs and group_b_idxs
    must have the same size. a and b can have duplicate indices and need not be necessarily
    disjoint. This function will automatically recenter the two groups of atoms before computing
    the rotation matrix. For relative binding free energy calculations, this restraint
    does not need to be turned off.

    Note that you should add a center of mass restraint as well to accomodate for the translational
    component.
