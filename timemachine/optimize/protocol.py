"""Offline protocol optimization

Setting
-------
Given simulation results from an initial alchemical protocol, we would like to construct a new protocol
whose intermediates are more "evenly spaced" according to something like "thermodynamic distance".

Approach
--------
* Define a "thermodynamic distance" between two values of lambda in terms of work standard deviation:
    "thermodynamic_distance(prev_lam, next_lam) = max(forward_work_stddev, reverse_work_stddev)"
* Compute a deterministic approximation of this distance by reweighting initial samples,
    and make this reweighting approximation extremely cheap by linearly interpolating previously computed energies.
* Build a protocol "left to right" by repeatedly using bisection to place the next lambda window at a fixed
    "thermodynamic distance" away from the previous window.

References
----------
1. The approach is directly inspired by "thermodynamic trailblazing," developed in Andrea Rizzi's thesis
    https://search.proquest.com/openview/0f0bda7dc135aad7216b6acecb815d3c/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y
    and implemented in Yank
    https://github.com/choderalab/yank/blob/59fc6313b3b7d82966afc539604c36f4db9b952c/Yank/pipeline.py#L1983-L2648
    * Similarities:
        * Overall problem framing
        * Notion of thermodynamic distance in terms of work standard deviation
        * Sequential search strategy
    * Differences:
        * Offline rather than online
        * "Lighter weight"
            Requires no new simulations, requires no new calls to the potential energy function, and
            doesn't even require to look at the stored samples.

2. This implementation grew out of previous protocol optimization approaches considered in timemachine:
    * https://github.com/proteneer/timemachine/pull/442
        Variant of "trailblazing", greedily constructing a protocol where
        forward work_stddev(i -> i+1) is intended to be ~ constant for all i, and where
        approximate samples from each lambda window are generated on the fly using short simulations
        initialized with samples from the previous lambda window.
    * https://github.com/proteneer/timemachine/pull/437
        Gradient-based optimization of high-dimensional protocols, using a reweighting-based estimate of a
        a T.I.-tailored objective, stddev(du/dlambda).
