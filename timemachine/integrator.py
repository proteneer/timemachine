    Compute coefficients for langevin dynamics

    Parameters
    ----------
    temperature: float
        units of Kelvin

    dt: float
        units of picoseconds

    friction: float
        collision rate in 1 / picoseconds

    masses: array
        mass of each atom in standard mass units

    Returns
    -------
    tuple (ca, cb, cc)
        ca is scalar, and cb and cc are n length arrays
        that are used during langevin dynamics as follows:

        during heat-bath update
        v -> ca * v + cc * gaussian

        during force update
        v -> v + cb * force
