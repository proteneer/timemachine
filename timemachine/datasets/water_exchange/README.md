This folder contains a list of prepared water structures for use in the examples/water_sampling.py script:

bb_centered_neutral.sdf C90-buckyball with zero charges (very difficult to insert any water inside)
bb_centered_espaloma.sdf C90-buckyball with espaloma charges (inserts 1-2 waters inside)
bb_waters_K_waters.pdb is a PDB file containing pure water (pre-initialized and de-clashed), such that there exactly K waters inside the C90 buckyball
